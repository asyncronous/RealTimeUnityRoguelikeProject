# Readme

This is a real-time-with-pause top down roguelike project I'm working on in Unity in my spare time. I've been working on the code base for a few years, which is terrible since I've done so little on it, but in my defence I knew zero code when I started. 

After I finally migrated to windows 10 I managed to break the original project, so I had to re-code everything I'd already done and I'm still working on rewriting a lot of it, right now the world and mesh generation algorithms.

## Planned Features

- Main Menu
- Seeded World Generation
- Cellular Automata / Random Walk map generation iterating over 2D arrays
- Randomised Mesh generation at runtime for walls/floors/trees etc (Randomised in the sense that the meshes look less like they're on a grid, the cubes are a random rhomboid shape)
- Random item generation, i.e. dagger of special effect: can be thrown and has an effect on hit [freeze, bleed, teleport] etc
- Random Enemy generation, i.e. mage of flame, generates with fire resistance items and items that induce flame effects
- IK and Procedurally generated animations for entities
- Ragdolls
- Destructible meshes
- Pause -> Action -> Execute -> Pause; Action loop when in combat. The game pauses so you have time to make your next move, and unpauses while your character executes the action.
